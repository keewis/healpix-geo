# HEALPix-geo: Geo-algorithms for HEALPix

`healpix-geo` is a Python library which contains geo-specific algorithms for healpix. It is built on top of the [cdshealpix rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/cdshealpix), but unlike the [cdshealpix python bindings](https://cds-astro.github.io/cds-healpix-python/index.html) it does not require `astropy`.

## Why HEALPix for Geosciences?

Traditional map projections introduce distortion: a cell at the equator covers a very different area than one near the poles.
DGGS (Discrete Global Grid Systems) such as HEALPix solve this by design — every cell at a given depth covers _exactly_ the same surface area.

Traditional map projections distort area and shape. DGGS like HEALPix provide equal-area, seamless global coverage.

## Principal Functionalities

- **Ellipsoid Support** : `healpix-geo` supports reference ellipsoids such as WGS84 for optimal geodetic accuracy.

- **Performances** : Rust implementation with Python bindings for fast computation, including native multi-threading support.

- **Geo-algorithms** : Coverage calculations, neighbor search, distance calculations...

- **Easy Integration** : Compatible with NumPy, compatible with visualization tools such as Matplotlib.
