# User Guide

This guide explains the fundamental concepts of healpix-geo and how to use them effectively.

## Guide organisation

### To start

If you begin with `healpix-geo` and HEALPix, read in the order :

1. {doc}`concepts` - Understand HEALPix and healpix-geo
2. {doc}`ellipsoids` - Reference system
3. {doc}`coordinates_systems` - Coordinates system

### Advanced functionalities

When the basis are acquired :

4. {doc}`hierarchical_indexing` - Hierarchical structure and navigation
5. {doc}`coverage_queries` - Cover request
6. {doc}`performance` - Optimisation of calculation

## Conventions

### Notation

In this guide, we are using the following conventions :

- `lon`, `lat` : Longitude and latitude
- `ipix` : Healpix cell index
- `depth` : Resolution level
- `ellipsoid` : Ellipsoidal model
