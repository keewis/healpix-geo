## releases

To trigger a release, create a release through the "draft releases" page of github.

Releases can happen independently per language, as long as the name of the tag matches `{language}-v*` where language is currently one of `python` and `js`. This will upload a version to the language-specific package index (PyPI for `python` and npmjs.org for `js`). npmjs.org packages are uploaded to the staging area and need to be manually confirmed through the website.

After the release is confirmed, activate a version build on ReadTheDocs (click on "add version" in the versions tab) and rename the slug from `python-v{version}` to just `v{version}`. If anything went wrong with the build, it is fine to push another tag called `python-docs-v{version}` (or anything, really, it should just be different from the release pattern above). Be aware that in that case you may have to choose a different slug such as `v{version}post0`.

Usually a version update will be triggered on conda-forge within a day, but if not (or you need to be faster than that), use a bot command issue to trigger a version update. You'll find a list of bot commands by choosing the "bot commands" issue template. Also be aware that "when in doubt, rerender" (through another bot command) can resolve a lot of conda-forge build issues.
